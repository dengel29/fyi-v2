## Position: [Utility Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player)

I joined Choxue to assess their digital product after a pivot in their core offering to users, and subsequently took on the position as Head of Digital Product to shepherd the product in that direction. In my year-long tenure I held several titles, from fullstack and devops engineer writing new features, to Head of Product internally pitching and budgeting new initiatives. 

## About Choxue

When I joined Choxue in late 2019, the mission was "to make sports a part of education". To accomplish this, Choxue created a high school basketball league in a spirit similar to American high school sports leagues. The one major barrier to students who want to participate (besides getting the okay from their principal and paying a registration fee) was their transcript: they need a minimum GPA to be placed on their team's roster. 

In 2017, when Choxue's original platform was built, however, the product was very different. Choxue had built a platform to film and edit sports highlights 

## Auditing a Legacy System

I joined Choxue after their website and development environment had been left untouched for about 1.5 years.

I spent a month auditing their legacy system, code base, digital assets, provided a cost-assessment of their AWS resources and gave the CEO my conclusions: while the code could be fixed and dependencies resolved, it would take months to become familiar with the undocumented system without the original developer there. This, coupled with the fact that company's strategy had changed dramatically since the original code was written, convinced me that fixing the old platform would not the best use of resources. I made a convincing case and the old platform was suspended, a notice put out to the few users still uplaoding info to it, and a data migration plan was developed.

## Building a Transcript Collection Tool

Collecting and analyzing our users' academic transcripts remained a high priority in Choxue's mission. In Choxue's first season before I joined, operations lost weeks of time sorting and determining students' eligibiility to play by hand.

A transcript collection tool was to be core to Choxue’s mission of making sure participants are student-athletes. The system was connected to the roster system, which would flag students with warnings or suspend students with grades that did not pass based on Choxue’s requirements. This was built in Angular and .NET, internationalized, included image upload, custom form validation, ability to quickly and easily copy records, authenticate coaches to batch update these records themselves, and had the potential to save dozens if not hundreds of man-hours. 

### Oversaw Handover from previous service provider to in-house solution

### Digital Re-Design
A sudden decision by the CEO to cut ties with Choxue's stats and service provider gave a short window to strategize for several key issues, including how to manage data from users until a new system was ready. I negotiated handover of data with previous service provider and created an intermediate data-store and website to display data, league images and update with league statistics until we had the time and resources to implement a more complete solution. At this time I also negotiated with and contracted a local UI/UX designer to accommodate new focus and features.
