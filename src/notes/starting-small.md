title: Starting Small
---

If you’re going into something new it’s a good idea to tame your ambitions.

Doesn’t matter what you’re doing, if you’re doing something new, it’s good to start small. One field I often hear this from is game developers: make small games.

Sometimes you’ll get lucky and have a small idea you can try out: I’d say you’ve struck gold if you already have a very simple thing you want to try out. There is a 100% certainty you’ll find a way to expand on it when you’re done, as long as you don’t overcomplicate things before you get there. 

This runs counter to “jumping into the deep end” ; I just like to think of it as “making your way to the deep end”.
