I'm nearly done with a 1.0 of this project I've been doing for the last month or so. It's important for me to make it good and useable, but it's a priority for me to get it out there instead of sitting on it until every little bit of perfect. **Good and released** is better than **perfect and forever stuck on a harddrive.** I'll make a proper post in the Projects section of this site when it's ready. In the meantime, try the good and release version on [supercut.fun](https://supercut.fun).
